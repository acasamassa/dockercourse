# Docker - Volumes

Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

Build your image:

`docker build -t 11-01myapp .`

## Types of volumes

- Host volumes: “I want my data to be here specifically”
 
To create and map a host volumen:

`docker run -v [host_path]:[container_path] [docker_image]`

-- --volume or -v: Bind mount a volume

Example:

Create a file named test.txt on the following Windows path: C:\testdocker

To create and map a host volumen:

`docker run --name 11-01myapprunning -p 8085:80 -d -v C:\testdocker:/data1 11-01myapp:latest`

Verify:

`docker exec -u root -ti 11-01myapprunning bash`

`cat /data1/test.txt`

Exit and list volumes:

`docker volume ls`

Delete container:

`docker rm -fv 11-01myapprunning`

- Anonymous volumes: “I just want a volume”

To create an anonymous volumen:

`docker run --name 11-01myapprunning -p 8085:80 -d -v /data1 11-01myapp:latest`

Verify:

`docker exec -u root -ti 11-01myapprunning bash`

`ls /data1/`

Exit and list volumes:

`docker volume ls`

Delete container (-f: does not delete the volume, -v: deletes the volume):

`docker rm -f 11-01myapprunning`

To delete a volume manually: 

`docker volume rm [volume_name]`

- Named volumes: “I want to refer to my data later easily”

To create a volumen:

`docker volume create [volume_name]`

`docker volume create myvolumen`

Assing the volume:

`docker run --name 11-01myapprunning -p 8085:80 -d -v myvolumen:/data1 11-01myapp:latest`

Delete container (-v: won't delete the volume):

`docker rm -fv 11-01myapprunning`

List volumes:

`docker volume ls`

To inspect the volume:

`docker volume inspect [volume_name]`

`docker volume inspect myvolumen`

To delete a volume manually: 

`docker volume rm [volume_name]`

`docker volume rm myvolumen`

List volumes:

`docker volume ls`
